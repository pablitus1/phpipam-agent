* Configure a remote agent (Administration > scan agents), get the key.

### Run this container (On same machine)

Pass the MySQL password and the phpipam agent key.

```bash
$ docker run -ti -d -e PHPIPAM_AGENT_KEY=dummy-key -e MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw --name ipam-agent --link phpipam-mysql:mysql pierrecdn/phpipam-agent
```

### Run this container (Outside on remote location)

Pass the MySQL password and the phpipam agent key.

```bash
$ docker run -ti -d -e PHPIPAM_AGENT_KEY=dummy-key -e MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw --name ipam-agent --add-host mysql:<mysql ip or fqdn> phpipam-agent
```

Now, the discovery scans will be performed every 1mn by default.

The logs are available on stdout/stderr (allowing to use `docker logs`).
